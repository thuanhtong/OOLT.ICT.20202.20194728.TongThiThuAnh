The Aims class must be updated to handle any exceptions generated when the play() methods are
called. What happens when you donâ€™t update for them to catch?
	- if we don't update for them, the program will be caused by some problems about Unhandled exception
which make the program stop working correctly:
	Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem: 
	Unhandled exception type PlayerException
